# Abstract

Write a 200–300 word IMRaD abstract (Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions).

# Background

-   Global burden of diarrheal disease; why water treatment.\
-   Prior evidence and gaps.\
-   Protocol registration (if applicable).

# Objectives

-   **Primary:** Effect on all-cause under-5 mortality.\
-   **Secondary:** e.g., diarrhea, hospitalizations.\
-   **Economic:** Cost-effectiveness by delivery model.

# Methods

## Eligibility criteria

Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes, Design (RCTs / cluster RCTs).

## Information sources & search strategy

Databases, dates, languages, gray literature; full strings in Appendix A.

## Study selection

Dual screening; PRISMA flow:

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
  A[Records identified] --> B[After deduplication]
  B --> C[Title/abstract screening]
  C -->|Excluded| D[Reasons listed]
  C --> E[Full-text assessed]
  E -->|Excluded with reasons| F[Full-text exclusions]
  E --> G[Qualitative synthesis]
  G --> H[Meta-analysis]
```

## Data extraction & risk of bias

Independent extraction; RoB 2; cluster adjustments.

## Effect measures & synthesis

Primary measure: Odds Ratio (OR); random-effects; τ², I²; prediction interval; small-study bias.

## Subgroups & sensitivity

By intervention type, baseline water quality, age; leave-one-out; RoB-restricted.

## Certainty (GRADE)

Summarize certainty; prepare SoF table.

## Results

Study selection; characteristics; risk of bias; effects (primary & secondary).

### Summary of Findings (mortality)

| Outcome | Comparator | OR (95% CI) | Absolute effect/1,000 | N (k) | Certainty |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Under-5 mortality | No treatment | 0.XX (0.XX–0.XX) | X fewer (Y–Z fewer) | N (k) | ⨁⨁⨁◯ |

## Economic evaluation

Perspective, cost inputs, DALY assumptions, ICERs by delivery model.

## Discussion

Main findings vs prior reviews; limitations; external validity; policy notes.

## Conclusions

One-paragraph, actionable takeaway.

## Funding

State funders or “none”.

## Conflicts of interest

Declare any potential conflicts.

## Data & code availability

Repository link and access notes.

### Appendix B. Risk of bias details

### Appendix C. Subgroup/sensitivity analyses

### Appendix D. Cost inputs & assumptions
